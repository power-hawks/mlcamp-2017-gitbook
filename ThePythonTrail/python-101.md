# PYTHON 101

Most of the intermediate and advanced tools and techniques for machine learning \(that we will cover\) require knowledge of Python \(the programming language\). In particular, we expect that students will need a primer in the following aspects of Python that we hope to cover in these notes.

1. _Strings, numbers, and variables_
2. _Statements, operators, and expressions_
3. _Lists, tuples, and dictionaries_
4. _Conditions, loops_
5. _Procedures, objects, modules, and libraries_
6. _Troubleshooting and debugging_
7. _Research & Documentation_
8. _Problem solving_
9. _Algorithms and data structures_

These topics reflect the pre-requisites outline in the [Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). We will try to cover these in full though we may not necessarily do those in the same order.

It is our hope that some subset of Study Campers will consider following through and enrolling in that program to complete projects and obtain their certification in due course. However, that is a paid program. Our focus on Study Camp is leverage freely available resources first to ensure that all campers get foundational understanding of the concepts before they enroll in any paid program.
